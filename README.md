[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FranklinChen/spreadsheet-ocaml.png)](https://travis-ci.org/FranklinChen/spreadsheet-ocaml)

This is a verbatim copy of the highly imperative dataflow system implemented in OCaml given in ["How to implement a spreadsheet"](http://semantic-domain.blogspot.com/2015/07/how-to-implement-spreadsheet.html), along with a test harness and a Travis build.
